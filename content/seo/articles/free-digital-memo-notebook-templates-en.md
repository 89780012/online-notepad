3. **Work Principles**: Principles for effective operation in organizations

## Core Viewpoint Excerpts

### 1. Radical Transparency and Radical Truth-Seeking

**Personal Understanding**: Transparency is the foundation of building trust, but it needs to be within appropriate boundaries.

### 2. The Value of Making Mistakes
> "People who don't make mistakes are usually those who don't take sufficient risks, and taking appropriate risks is a necessary condition for learning and progress."

**Application Thinking**: In work, reasonable trial and error should be encouraged rather than excessively pursuing perfection.

### 3. Believability-Weighted Decision Making
> "When making decisions, opinions should be weighted according to each person's believability in relevant areas."

**Practical Methods**:
- Evaluate speakers' professional backgrounds
- Consider success rates of past decisions
- Value advice from practical experience

## Golden Quote Excerpts
1. "Pain + Reflection = Progress"
2. "Evolve or die"
3. "The most important thing is knowing how to thoughtfully disagree with smart people with an open mind"
4. "The key to success is thinking both big picture and paying attention to details"

## Chapter Highlights

### Chapter 1: Embrace Reality and Deal with It
- **Reality Acceptance**: Accepting reality is the first step to solving problems
- **Problem Identification**: Accurately identifying problems is more important than solving them
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Dig deep into the fundamental causes of problems

### Chapter 2: Use Five-Step Process to Achieve Life Goals

## Lecture 3: Stacks and Queues (September 21, 2025)

### Key Points of This Session
1. Definition and operations of Stack
2. Definition and operations of Queue
3. Application scenarios for stacks and queues
4. Implementing stacks and queues with arrays and linked lists

### Detailed Notes

#### 1. Stack
**Definition**: Last In First Out (LIFO) linear data structure

**Basic Operations**:
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        """Push operation, time complexity O(1)"""
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        """Pop operation, time complexity O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def peek(self):
        """View top element without removing"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if stack is empty"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def size(self):
        """Return stack size"""
        return len(self.items)
```

**Application Scenarios**:
- **Expression Evaluation**: Infix to postfix expression conversion
- **Function Calls**: Program call stack
- **Parentheses Matching**: Check balanced parentheses
- **Undo Operations**: Editor's Ctrl+Z functionality

**Practical Application Example: Parentheses Matching**
```python
def is_balanced(expression):
    """Check if parentheses are balanced"""
    stack = Stack()
    pairs = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}

    for char in expression:
        if char in pairs:  # Opening bracket
            stack.push(char)
        elif char in pairs.values():  # Closing bracket
            if stack.is_empty():
                return False
            last_open = stack.pop()
            if pairs[last_open] != char:
                return False

    return stack.is_empty()

# Test cases
print(is_balanced("()"))        # True
print(is_balanced("([{}])"))    # True
print(is_balanced("([)]"))      # False
```

#### 2. Queue
**Definition**: First In First Out (FIFO) linear data structure

**Basic Operations**:
```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Enqueue operation, add to rear"""
        self.items.insert(0, item)

    def dequeue(self):
        """Dequeue operation, remove from front"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def front(self):
        """View front element"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if queue is empty"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def size(self):
        """Return queue size"""
        return len(self.items)
```

**Application Scenarios**:
- **Task Scheduling**: Operating system process scheduling
- **Breadth-First Search**: BFS in graph algorithms
- **Buffer Management**: Data stream processing
- **Print Queue**: Printer task management

### Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Stack | Queue |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Insert | O(1) | O(1) |
| Delete | O(1) | O(1) |
| Access | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |

### Class Exercises
1. **Exercise 1**: Implement queue using stacks
```python
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = []  # For enqueue
        self.stack2 = []  # For dequeue

    def enqueue(self, x):
        self.stack1.append(x)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop() if self.stack2 else None
```

2. **Exercise 2**: Implement stack using queues
```python
class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def push(self, x):
        self.queue.append(x)
        # Move front elements to back
        for _ in range(len(self.queue) - 1):
            self.queue.append(self.queue.pop(0))

    def pop(self):
        return self.queue.pop(0) if self.queue else None
```

### Questions and Thoughts
❓ **Question 1**: Why is queue's enqueue operation using insert(0) inefficient?
💡 **Thinking**: Because insert(0) needs to move all elements, time complexity is O(n). Better implementation would use double-ended queue (deque).

❓ **Question 2**: How to optimize queue implementation?
💡 **Answer**:
- Use double-ended queue (collections.deque)
- Use circular array
- Use linked list implementation

### Homework
- [ ] Complete textbook Chapter 3 exercises 1-5
- [ ] Implement a MinStack
- [ ] Use stack to implement calculator function
- [ ] Research Python deque implementation principles

### Next Session Preview
